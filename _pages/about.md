# History

I grew up in Camb√©, Brazil. I went to State University of Londrina (UEL) from 2006-2010 where I got a BS in Computer Science. After graduating I moved to Campinas and got a master graduation on State University of Campinas (Unicamp). After that I left my academic career and worked on different companies: Dextra (4 years), MATERA Systems (1 year) and Confidence Exchange (2 years). I moved to Porto Alegre on 2017 to work on CWI Software.
