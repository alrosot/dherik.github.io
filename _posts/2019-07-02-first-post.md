Hello!

This is now my official page (and blog)! I've been writing for a while some articles on my previous [Blog](https://qualidadegarantida.blogspot.com) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@dherik) (both on Brazillian Portuguese). But now I'm feel prepared to take a bigger step and write for a bigger audience using the most popular language on the world. 

The other news is my new domain. I already bought the [dherik.com](dherik.com) domain. I will use it to point to this blog!

I will still publishing some portuguese articles on Medium. As the CWI Software publish most of my articles, this is a good deal to help to promote this blog. My old blog will be still online until I understand that it's time to disactivated, but I don't have any intention to do that soon.
