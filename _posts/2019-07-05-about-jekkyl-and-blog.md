How I create this page?

Has been a while since I came with the idea to buy a domain and create a profissional page (and blog!) to expose some of my work and share my experiences and thoughts.

My biggest concern was: where I could host this page?

I make my research and many candidates appeared. As I was thinking to use Wordpress or something similar, the HostGator appeared as an possible option. It's not an expensive host, but I could make the things more fun.

So I came out with the idea to use Amazon or Azure. I could setup from scratch a webpage paying the minimum amount of money to maintain this server (I'm not expecting a big traffic here, of course). The big problem here is the cost of a database. Without the database, on Amazon this will cost something between 6 or 7 dollars for month. 

What could I do without a database? I've already heard about the static sites engines before and how useful it was for blogs. My first contact with this kind of technology was on 2013 with [Axe](http://augustocampos.net/axe/blog/2013/06/o-que-e-o-axe.html), a portuguese static content manager developed by [Augusto Campos](https://twitter.com/augustocc).

After some research about what the best options of static content manager we have nowadays, I figure out my lack of time to dedicate for this little setup. I needed something more practical and, why not, free? 

Finally, I found the answer of my prays on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Github have a [native support for the Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), one the most famous static content managers available. And not only that, you can choose a Jekyll template among a lot of template repositories that are ready to use; you just need to fork it and you have a functional blog. 

My choice was the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). I forkes their repository, rename to [dherik.github.io](https://dherik.github.io) and done!

I really need to dig and understand better how powerful this content manager is to apply some customizations on my blog. But for now the Jekyll is more than enough for my needs.
