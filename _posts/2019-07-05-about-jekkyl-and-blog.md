How I create this page?

Has been a while since I came with the idea to buy a domain and create a profissional page (and blog!) to expose some of my work and share my experiences and thoughts.

My biggest concern was: where I could host this page?

I make my research and many candidates appeared. As I was thinking to use Wordpress or something similar, the HostGator appeared as an possible option. It's not an expensive host, but I could make the things more fun. So I just bought my [dherik.com](https://dherik.com) domain there and move on.

So I came out with the idea to use Amazon or Azure. I could setup from scratch a webpage paying a minimum amount of money to maintain this server (I'm not expecting a big traffic here, of course). On Amazon this will cost something between 6 or 7 dollars, what is a bit expensive for a so simple site. Something simpler will fit better.

I've already heard about the static sites engines before and how useful it was for blogs and personal pages. My first contact with this kind of technology was on 2013 with [Axe](http://augustocampos.net/axe/blog/2013/06/o-que-e-o-axe.html), a portuguese static content manager developed by [Augusto Campos](https://twitter.com/augustocc).

After some research about what are the best options of static content manager nowadays, I figure out my lack of time to dedicate for this setup. I needed something more practical and, why not, free? 

Finally, I found the answer of my prays on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Github have a [native support for the Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), one the most famous static content managers available. And not only that, you can choose a Jekyll template among a lot of template repositories that are ready to use; you just need to fork it and you have a functional blog. 

My template choice was the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). I forked their repository, rename to [dherik.github.io](https://dherik.github.io) and done!

The last step was point the [dherik.com](https://dherik.com) domain to [dherik.github.io](https://dherik.github.io). With a little help from CloudFare, I could do that easily.
